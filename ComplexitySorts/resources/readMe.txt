This is a read me explaining how to run the ComplexitySorts sort.jar file

Navigate to the directory you have the sort.jar file ex C:\Users\yourname\

then enter in the sort.jar file using java  ex C:\Users\yourname\java -jar sort.jar

now you can enter the polyfor1.txt or other relavent txt file instantiated by a -f

ex C:\Users\yourname\java -jar sort.jar -f polyfor1.txt

now you can choose how you want to sort instantiated by a -t then either 
	height 'h' 
	area 'a' 
	volume 'v'

and choose which sorting algorithm instantiated by a -s then either
	bubble 'b'
	selection 's'
	insertion 'i'
	merge 'm'
	quicksort 'q'
	Custom (heapsort) 'z'

Here are some fully executed examples

C:\Users\yourname\java -jar sort.jar -f polyfor1.txt -t h -s b
this will sort height by a bubble sort

C:\Users\yourname\java -jar sort.jar -f polyfor1.txt -t a -s q
this will sort area by a quick sort

C:\Users\yourname\java -jar sort.jar -f polyfor1.txt -t v -s z
this will sort volume by a heap sort
